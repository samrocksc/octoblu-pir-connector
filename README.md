octoblu-pir-connector
=====================

Connects octoblu to my pir connectors using johnny-five, 2 pir sensors, and a arduino nano loaded with standard firmata.

It is a fork and modify of my johnny-five function storing data to a JSON file which can be found [here](https://github.com/samrocksc/johnny-five-pir-counter "Johnny-Five Json Connector for PIR")
